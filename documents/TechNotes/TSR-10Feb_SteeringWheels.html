        <blockquote>

          <p>The title of this column was conceived somewhat whimsically as a
            disclaimer to highlight my utter lack of technical expertise. I have only
            restored one car (with substantial assistance from several experts), and
            during the course of that titanic clash of a novice’s ignorance with hard
            steel, Cecil Kimber’s mechanical genius, the mischievous SU carburetor, and
            the nearly mythical vagaries of the Lucas electrical system, I lost many
            battles in trying to restore even the simplest components. During the
            painful and sobering course of that humbling struggle, I sustained cuts,
            bruises, minor burns, skin rashes and a temporarily compromised respiratory
            system, but I did not acquire anything that you could call technical
            expertise. I only had the experience. My object in this column to pass on
            some of that “experience.” Perhaps some small part of it may be of interest,
            or even helpful, to others who are restoring their cars or just trying to
            improve them a little bit at a time.</p>
          <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Steering Wheel Restoration</strong></p>
          <p>I have a steering wheel on my TD that I really like, but it is not a proper
            TD wheel. It has a marbled look, with light and dark browns swirled
            together. It looks great against the burled walnut of the dashboard. (Oops,
            fascia). Someone told me it was a period correct aftermarket wheel. One
            expert called it a Bluemels banjo type wheel. One sees many T-Series cars
            with the popular black plastic Brooklands-type steering wheel, but this is
            not correct for a TD or TF. (If you are interested in a new Brooklands wheel
            purportedly made to original specs, try John Kimble in the UK at
            <a href="mailto:john@johnkimble.co.uk">john@johnkimble.co.uk</a>.) The Brooklands wheel was installed as
            original
            equipment on earlier T-Series cars: the TA, TB and TC. The proper steering
            wheel for a TD is a wheel that is a non-marbled cream or light tan color.
            One restoration expert advised me that the Moss version of the TD wheel,
            offered in their catalogue as Part No. 454-230 ($299.95), is about as close
            as you can come to the proper wheel. It does not include the hub assembly,
            Part No. 262-340, which Moss offers separately ($79.95).</p>
          <p>While I want to keep my car as original as possible, I like my existing,
            non-proper, marbled wheel so much I wanted to keep it. The problem is that
            the wheel has some cracks in it, particularly where the spokes meet the
            wheel itself. If the spokes were to separate from the wheel during
            aggressive driving, it could be disastrous. So, I thought, the thing to do
            would be to restore the wheel since I could not find a vendor selling
            anything like it. I remembered from the MG BBS that Eastwood offers a
            steering wheel restoration kit, Parts Nos. 52196Z and 52194Z, and a book,
            Part No. 52017. But these kits appear to be for solid-colored wheels, not
            marbled wheels like mine.</p>
          <p>My next thought was to look for a steering
            wheel restorer. Besides, the more I thought about restoring my beloved
            steering wheel myself, the less I liked the idea. It is clearly one of those
            jobs that comes out much better the second, third or tenth time one does it.
            I was only doing it one time, and I really didn’t want to mess up my wheel.</p>
          <p>I went to the MG T-Series BBS (www.british-cars.co.uk) and looked in the
            archives. I didn’t find anything, so I started a thread on the topic. Sure
            enough, I received a response identifying a guy who restores wheels, but his
            website didn’t work. I tracked him down; his name is Gary, and he lives in
            Carlisle, PA. He’s been doing this sort of work for quite a while
            (<a href="http://www.garyssteeringwheel.com">www.garyssteeringwheel.com</a>). While talking with other
            vendors, I also found
            another firm that does this work: PearlCraft Steering Wheels in Australia
            (<a href="http://www.pearlcraft.com.au">www.pearlcraft.com.au</a>). Both these vendors have well-developed
            web sites,
            each with numerous photos of their work. Their steering wheel restorations
            do not come cheap, being more expensive than buying a proper wheel from
            Moss. But their workmanship looks very good judging from the photos.</p>
          <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Nickel Plating, Again</strong></p>
          <p>In my last article, I wrote about the several
            parts of a T-Series MG that were nickel plated, including the grip of the
            hand crank (in some cases), ID plates near the tool box, and the oil fill
            cap on top of the valve cover. I have not seen many cars with these parts
            properly nickel coated. As I mentioned in the last issue, the hand crank
            grip is generally displayed as polished brass or painted black. The ID
            plates are sold by Moss as brass plates, and the oil fill cap is commonly
            painted silver to match the valve cover.</p>
          <p>Wishing to nickel plate
            these parts on my car, I solicited and received a quote from a company
            offering this service. The price was astronomical. Actually, it was more
            than astronomical; it was cosmic. It was totally... Well, you get the idea.
            I had assumed that since the parts were relatively small and since it was
            nickel and not chrome, the vendor’s quoted fee would be less than the cost
            of re-chroming. My assumption was very wrong. My intuition and my experience
            with re-chromers told me that it probably was not going to do much good to
            solicit estimates from other vendors, so I started to look for other
            solutions. For some time, I have been satisfactorily and very economically
            zinc plating various hardware bits from my car in my own garage using the
            Eastwood kit. I thought if I could do it with zinc, why couldn’t I do it
            with nickel? There shouldn’t be much difference in the chemistry and, after
            all, this is the sort of stuff you did in high school chemistry class. (They
            do it in grade school now.) So I decided to find a vendor who sells a nickel
            plating kit for home use. I looked in several catalogues of well known
            suppliers, and I searched online, but I found nothing. In addition, I found
            nothing on eBay and Amazon. Out of frustration and uncharacteristically, I
            tried YouTube. I thought it was crazy to think I would find anything on
            electroplating there, let alone nickel electroplating. I was pretty sure I
            would find music videos, whacky videos, videos that your poker buddies would
            send you as a joke, stuff for kids, etc. But finding something on You Tube
            about nickel plating just did not seem likely. Sure enough though, there
            were not one but several helpful videos on You Tube on how to nickel plate.
            Actually, it is even more surprising. I found a mini-series describing
            nickel plating on You Tube. The author of this mini-series is styled
            “JimmyV2009,” and I found his videos to be the most helpful. Two of his
            videos are entitled Nickel Plating Made Easy (Part 1 and Part 2). Each part
            is about six minutes in length, covering the basics of the equipment, the
            chemicals and the process. He also has videos entitled How to Make Nickel
            Acetate Solution for Use in Electroplating (2 hours:32 minutes) and Nickel
            Plating Power Supply (0:28 minutes). These videos are not going to win
            Oscars, but they clearly and forcefully demonstrate that nickel
            electroplating in your own garage is possible, very economical and safe.
            (Nickel acetate is very toxic.) So, I am going to order some nickel acetate,
            find a nickel welding rod and try it. I will report the results in the next
            issue.</p>
