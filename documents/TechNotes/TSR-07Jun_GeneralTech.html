        <blockquote>

          <p>Several months ago I got an email from someone who was soon to be our newest
            member. He was looking for a TD to purchase and I told him about one I knew
            of but had never seen. The car was located in northeastern MD and a bit of a
            drive from northern VA. But Milton made the trip and was pleased with what
            he found. We talked while he was there and the car did have a few running
            problems but the basic car seemed OK, for the price. Milton purchased the
            car and trailered it home.</p>
          <p>
            <img alt="Blinky Bill Page 1" height="417" src="../../images/TechNotes/img46.jpg" style="float: right"
              width="320">For the past few months Milton and I have been working through the problems with
            the car and have corrected many things. The previous owner had the carbs
            rebuilt and a valve job done and numerous sessions with his mechanic to get
            it running right. Apparently this never was completely successful and I
            think the reason for the sale of the car. Milton has fixed a lot of things
            on this car so far. He has never had an antique car before or done any car
            mechanical work to any extent. I seemed to have been able to convince him
            that MGs are hardy cars and respond to the correct type of attention. He
            purchased a shop manual and a set of SU tools and a Unisyn. We spent a lot
            of time talking about SU's and how they work and checked and looked for the
            problems with this pair. Stuck jets and chokes. Mixture out of wack. The
            biggie was one of the overflow tubes was slightly clogged. Thanks for
            reminding me, Bill Ludtke. He's retorqued the head, adjusted the valves and
            set the timing. Air pressure, shock links, shock fluid and toe in. Spark
            plugs were correct but set to .012". Binding choke cable too. Checked out
            the SU fuel pump and changed the oil a few times due to fuel contamination,
            our current problem. Milton loves the car. It rewards him with successes.
            It's an MG and they are just that way. Did I tell you I have never actually
            met Milton, but we've spent several hours on the phone. If you need your
            SU's tweaked, you might converse with Milton Babirak. He's gotten quite good
            at it!</p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;
            By now I hope everyone is aware of the reduction of the anti-wear oil additive
            ZDDP to our normally available motor oils. This was reduced to make
            emissions friendlier to the catalytic converter on modern cars. It does not
            help our engines with flat tappets though, and without it premature cam lobe
            and lifter wear may occur. I won't go into a lot here but I do recommend
            that if you are not versed on this you should find out by searching the
            Internet and current car mags. A lot is being written and basically what you
            want to use is one of the few remaining oils with higher levels of ZDDP such
            as racing oils. I checked Castrol's website and they seem to be working on a
            <img alt="Blinky Bill Page 2" height="490" src="../../images/TechNotes/img47.jpg" style="float: right"
              width="320">remedy for us. I remember having a discussion with Geoffrey Griffiths many
            years ago. Geoffrey has been one of our BCD vendors for many years and we
            were talking about how you hardly ever heard of engine failures and worn out
            engines like you used to. Granted, we don't drive the cars nearly as much or
            as hard, but we realized that it was the advances in motor oils that are
            most likely, at least partly responsible. With the loss of this valuable (to
            us) additive we may be taking a big step back for our engines, but hopefully
            for the short term.</p>
          <p>When talking about radiators, have you heard the
            term "rodding out" I have heard this term before and have even requested
            that it be done on a clogged radiator from time to time. But I never
            actually saw it done. A friend up here is a retired radiator repair shop
            owner and still does some side work. I was over at his shop one day and he
            has a Model A Ford radiator with the top tank unsoldered and removed and the
            bottom pipe hooked up to a garden hose. It's laying on a pallet with a brick
            propping up the opened end. He is sliding a flat rod in and out of the
            exposed tube ends and I watch as clumps of rusty matter tumble out with the water flow. Next
            hole the rod gets stuck and when he pulls it out it's covered in grease.
            "Water pump over greased" he says. I never really thought about why the shop
            manuals always tells you one or two strokes of the grease gun for the water
            pump. Seems it gets past the seal, melts and liquefies and then solidifies
            in the tubes when it cools down and there after starts the clogging process.
            Something to be aware of. I guess I should wonder how I got this old and did
            not know that.</p>
          <p>But wait there's more! See the portrait of Blinky Bill
            the ESSO gremlin #6 from 1943. Looks like we already had automobile
            electrical gremlins here in the US long before the little TC hit our shores.
            So when you think of the Prince of Darkness, know that your MG may have
            arrived here in pristine condition and was infected by Blinky Bill who is
            quite happy to have Sir Joseph Lucas take all the blame.</p>
