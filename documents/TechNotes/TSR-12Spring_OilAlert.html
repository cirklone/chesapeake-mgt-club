					<p><em>Ed. Note: John Hambleton drew our attention in late January to an
							item posted on the web site of the MG Car Club/UK that apparently endorsed
							use of an oil additive called ZDDP in vintage cars which, like our T-Series
							MGs, have engines with flat tappets. He recalled having used Valvoline VR1
							racing oil in his own TD in the past, bottles of which bore labels stating:
							"enhanced ZDDP for flat tappet engines." John noted, however, that those
							labels no longer appear on Valvoline bottles, and he wondered why ZDDP
							seldom, if ever, can be found nowadays in most brands of motor oil available
							in auto parts stores in our area. The brand recommended on the MG Car
							Club/UK's web site, he reported, is "Brad Penn."</em></p>
					<p><em>Unfortunately, we encountered difficulty in navigating the MG Car
							Club/UK's web site. Once we finally figured out how to do it, the item in
							question was no longer accessible. But recently (Feb. 29), another article
							on the use of ZDDP appeared in the February 2012 newsletter of Bay British
							Cars, an MG club based in Panama City, Florida. Thanks to our membership in
							the MG Editors Exchange Group, we are able to reproduce it below. We think
							members will find it worth reading.</em></p>
					<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Oil Alert for Older Cars</strong></p>
					<p class="auto-style2"><em>By Eric Peters</em></p>
					<p>In order to comply with federal requirements that key emissions control
						components on new cars such as catalytic converters work (and can be
						warranted to work) for at least 120,000 miles (previously, it was 100,000
						miles) automakers have been pushing for reductions in an oil additive known
						as zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate (ZDDP), which contains phosphorous (as well
						as zinc and manganese).</p>
					<p>The problem for late model cars is that the phosphorous in ZDDP has been
						linked with premature catalytic converter failure — or at least, premature
						loss of converter efficiency.</p>
					<p>But the problem for older cars (generally, stuff built before the
						early-mid 1980s) with flat tappet (vs. roller-type) camshafts is that oils
						with low ZDDP levels may accelerate wear, and even cause premature failure,
						of flat tappet camshafts. In a nutshell, the ZDDP additives cushion the high
						pressure point between the lifter crown and the camshaft lobe, acting as an
						anti-friction, anti-wear barrier. The stuff is especially critical in
						just-rebuilt engines, during the initial break-in period.</p>
					<p>Levels of ZDDP in commonly available mainstream motor oils — including
						big-name brands and high dollar synthetics — have been dropping since the
						new emissions longevity requirements became effective with the 2004 model
						year, almost eight years ago now. Unfortunately, many owners of older cars
						with flat tappet camshafts are unaware of the changing formulations — and
						the threat low-ZDDP (and even possibly no ZDDP) oils may represent.</p>
					<p>The situation is analogous to the early 1970s, when lead (a lubricant and
						octane enhancer) began to disappear from gasoline. Engines that had been
						designed to burn leaded fuel –— especially high-performance engines run at
						high RPMs — suffered premature valve recession caused by the use of unleaded
						fuel.</p>
					<p>So, what to do about the disappearance of ZDDP?</p>
					<p>The first thing is to determine whether your vehicle is equipped with a
						flat tappet camshaft. If it’s an American brand car or truck older than
						model year 1980 and the engine is a V-8 or V-6 (or inline six), the odds are
						virtually 100 percent certain that you have an engine with a flat tappet
						camshaft.</p>
					<p>By the latter half of the ’80s and into the 1990s, roller-style camshafts
						were becoming the norm — and if you have a car from that era or newer, you
						are probably safe using currently available oil formulations. But it’s
						important to be sure. You won’t find information on the type of camshaft
						your vehicle has in your owner’s manual. You’ll need to consult a technical
						service manual — or ask someone who is knowledgeable. The service manager at
						a dealership for your make/model of car ought to know — or should be able to
						find out.</p>
					<p>What to use?</p>
					<p>There are still a few oils on the market that have adequate (pre-2004)
						levels of ZDDP. These include Shell Rotella T — a conventional
						(mineral-based) oil that was originally formulated for diesel engines.
						Rotella T still contains 1,200 parts per million ZDDP, according to Shell —
						which is as much as five times the amount found in other oils. Don’t sweat
						it that Rotella was/is marketed “for diesels.” It’s also an excellent choice
						for older non-emissions controlled engines with flat tappet cams that need
						their ZDDP. Rotella’s also modestly priced and readily available at almost
						any auto parts store. Shell also markets a relatively synthetic version of
						Rotella that offers even more protection — as well as longevity and a 5W-40
						viscosity for those who operate their vehicles in colder climates. Standard
						Rotella comes in a heavier 15W-40 blend.</p>
					<p>Another choice — in a full synthetic — is Amsoil which carries a line of
						oils with ZDDP in popular viscosities such as 10W-40 and heavier 20W-50.
						Redline oil is also still fine for older engines with flat tappet cams.
						Unfortunately, both Amsoil and Redline can be hard to find at your local
						store; but if you plan ahead, you can order a case from any one of multiple
						suppliers online and just keep a stash on hand. Royal Purple is good stuff,
						too — and (at least in my area, Virginia) is usually available at your local
						major auto parts place.</p>
					<p>Another option is additives. GM used to sell an over-the-counter Engine
						Oil Supplement (EOS) that was just what the doctor ordered — and for only
						about $12 per bottle. Unfortunately, GM stopped making the stuff, and it’s
						now very hard to find.</p>
					<p>Competition Cams does offer something similar — its Engine Break-in Oil
						Additive. Comp Cams used to recommend this for initial break-in but now
						recommends that it be added with the oil at every oil change. From Tech
						Bulletin 225:</p>
					<p>“While this additive was originally developed specifically for break-in
						protection, subsequent testing has proven the durability benefits of its
						long term use. This special blend of additives promotes proper break-in and
						protects against premature cam and lifter failure by replacing some of the
						beneficial ingredients that the oil companies have been required to remove
						from off-the-shelf oil.”</p>
					<p>_____________________________</p>
					<p><em>Ed. Note: Well, it finally turns out that ZDDP has not disappeared
							from Valvoline VR1 after all! On March 1, John Tokar at Vintage
							Restorations, Ltd. was moved to clarify the issue, as follows:</em></p>
					<p>"I'd like to provide some information on Valvoline VR1 racing oil. My
						recent conversation with Dave Weakly, a Valvoline Product Support
						Specialist, resulted in the return correspondence copied below. According to
						Dave, it was a product-labeling decision to remove the statement "enhanced
						ZDDP for flat tappet engines" from the VR1 label. The product is unchanged
						and is a very suitable motor oil for use in our T-types.</p>
					<p>"Dave also sent me some tech sheets showing the high zinc and phosphorous
						content in the oil.</p>
					<p>"So, no need to worry — this oil is still a great choice and we recommend
						it to all of our customers."</p>
					<p><em>For the record, this is what Dave Weakley had to say in his email to
							John Tokar dated March 1, 2012:</em></p>
					<p>"Thank you for contacting Valvoline Product Support with your question
						about the Valvoline VR1 and its ZDDP levels.</p>
					<p>"The Valvoline VR1 Racing Oils still contain 1,400ppm (parts per million)
						Zinc and 1,300ppm Phosphorus. Which is more than enough to properly protect
						an older Flat Tappet Cam style engine. As you have requested, attached is a
						copy of the Product Information Sheet for the Valvoline VR1 Racing Oils.</p>
					<p>"If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us via
						email or by phone at 800 TEAM VAL for assistance. Thank you once again for
						contacting Valvoline and have a great day.</p>
					<p>"Best regards, Dave / Valvoline Product Support "</p>
					<p><em>The tech sheets mentioned above are available to members, upon
							request, via Email. We look forward to perhaps hearing from more of you on
							his subject, and we're especially grateful to John Hambleton for bringing it
							to our attention in the first place. (He notes that Dave Weakley’s response
							to John Tokar is much more informative than the clerk/cashier at Advanced
							Auto Parts.)</em></p>
